                                    This
                                    had a major influence on him. Also, he graduated from school a year early.

                                    months and was near death. In a moment of desperation, Tesla's father agreed to send

                                    an engineering school, if he recovered from the illness. Tesla's father was a

                                    interest was in Electrical Engineering, which was spurred by his mother, who in her

                                    compulsory military service. Tesla later stated , "For most of this term I roamed in

                                    mountains, loaded with a hunter's outfit and a bundle of books, and this contact

                                    on a Military Border Scholarship. In his first year, he never missed a lecture, made

                                    came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme Dynamo, when he suggested
                                    that
                                    commutators were not necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his

                                    and took up gambling. Near the end of his third year, Tesla stopped attending
                                    lectures and
                                    dropped out the following year.

                                    engineering firm. He spent his spare time in the pub, where he played chess and

                                    him to return home, but Telsa refused. Tesla was reported the Maribor Police,
                                    because he did
                                    not have a residence permit. He was deported to Gospic. In April, Telsa's father
                                    died from
                                    an unspecified illness. Later in the year in Gospic, Tesla began teaching at his old

                                    in Karl-Ferdinand University. Even if he had arrived early enough, he would not have

                                    permitted to enroll, because he had never studied Greek and he did not speak or

                                    He spent most of his time at the Klementinum Library and Narodni Kavarna (People's

                                    did attend lectures at the University as an auditor, but did not receive marks for

                                    as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office. Within a few months, the Budapest

                                    Exchange became operational and he was assigned the position of Chief Electrian.

                                    employment, Tesla made numerous improvements to the equipment and developed an

                                    soon Tesla's automatic regulator was accepted. Tesla was likely expecting to be

                                    mutiny broke out on the ship, and Tesla was almost thrown overboard. A few weeks
                                    later, he
                                    arrived in New York with four cents in his pocket, a few poems, and remnants of his
                                    belongings. Shortly after arriving in New York, Thomas Edison essentially hired
                                    Telsa on the
                                    spot, but would hear nothing of his Alternating Current Power System.

                                    develop an improved arc lighting system. Although this was not the opportunity he

                                    succeeded beyond Edison expectations, but Edison reneged on his promise. Edison is

                                    Tesla ever loved was Katharine McMahon Johnson. She was the wife of Tesla's lifelong

                                    Robert Underwood Johnson. Though the two, Katharine and Tesla, often exchanged

                                    death, she charged her husband to keep in close touch with him always. For unknown

                                    Tesla relocated his office from 8W 40th Street to 350 Madison Avenue. By 1928 the
